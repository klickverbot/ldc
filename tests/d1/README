We have two different test sets. For the test drivers
you need do compile the .d files in this folder with
a Phobos D compiler.

To run the 'mini' test suite run
./runminitests

To run the DStress based tests execute
./runtest tmp-sensible-name
and then use 
./findregressions old-results new-results 
to display a list of regressions. You can
download old result files from
http://www.incasoftware.de/~kamm/ldc/reference
